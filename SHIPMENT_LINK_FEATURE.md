## How to Use

### Adding/Editing Links
1. Navigate to the Shipments dashboard
2. Find the shipment you want to add a link to
3. Click the "Edit" button in the Actions column
4. Enter the URL in the modal (must start with http:// or https://)
5. Click "Save" to confirm or "Cancel" to discard changes

### Viewing Link Content
1. Navigate to the Shipments dashboard
2. Look for shipments with green "ðŸ”— View Content" buttons
3. Click the "ðŸ”— View Content" button to see the link content in a modal
4. The content will be fetched and displayed directly in the dashboard
5. Use "Open in New Tab" to view the original website externally
6. If no link is available, an alert will be shown

### Default Link Pattern
When editing a shipment without a link, the system suggests a default pattern:
```
https://example.com/shipment/{SHIPMENT_NUMBER}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
The `Shipment` interface now includes an optional `link` field:
```typescript
interface Shipment {
  // ... existing fields
  link?: string
}
```

### State Management
- `editingLink` state tracks the currently editing link
- Link changes are persisted in the component state
- Links are included in CSV exports

### URL Validation
- Basic validation ensures URLs start with http:// or https://
- Invalid URLs show an alert and prevent saving

## Export Functionality
The CSV export now includes the link column, allowing users to export shipment data with associated links.

## Browser Compatibility
- Uses `fetch()` API to retrieve link content
- Includes CORS handling for cross-origin requests
- "Open in New Tab" option uses `window.open()` with `_blank` target
- Includes `noopener,noreferrer` for security
- Works in all modern browsers

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:
- Link preview functionality
- Bulk link editing
- Link categorization (tracking, documentation, etc.)
- Link analytics and click tracking
